        <p>My name is Alan Ramirez. I am 16 and currently attend a Code Nation fellowship at Dropbox NYC. I am proficient in HTML, CSS, Javascript and am searching for my enthusiasm for coding. I am an outgoing individual and enjoy challenges. I am consistent in school activities, clubs, and sports teams. Some of the best things I can remember are my participation in the school Yearbook which I still participate in, also my involvement in the Sailing Program. Within both programs I am/was a natural leader.      </p>
